# UnityNarrativeDialogsSystem

Unity fading in and out dialogs system for storytelling and tutorial purposes.
I extracted it from the [Global Game Jam 2023 project](https://rowdaboat.itch.io/quest-for-the-black-yard) I participated on.
This separate project aims to improve it's design.
I rushed it during the jam, making some questionable initial decisions on said design.
Once improved, I'll keep it around for reuse on other projects.
