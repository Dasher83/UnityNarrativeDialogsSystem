# TO DO

1. Use scriptable objects directly, get rid of unnecessary Json serialization and deserialization. 
2. Add parallel processing consistency, either use coroutines or async / await, not both.  
3. Prevent more than one dialog sequence to be run simultaneously.  
4. Add testing UI that can play, pause and change dialog sequences.
