# TO DO

1. Create Editor tool to hide serializable fields conditionally for DialogElement script.
2. Use scriptable objects directly, get rid of unnecessary Json serialization and deserialization.
3. Add parallel processing consistency, either use coroutines or async / await, not both.  
4. Prevent more than one dialog sequence to be run simultaneously.  
5. Add testing UI that can play, pause and change dialog sequences.
