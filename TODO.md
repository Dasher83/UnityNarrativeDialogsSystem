# TO DO

1. Use scriptable objects directly, get rid of unnecessary Json serialization and deserialization.
2. Rename namespace.
3. Add parallel processing consistency, either use coroutines or async / await, not both.  
4. Prevent more than one dialog sequence to be run simultaneously.  
5. Add testing UI that can play, pause and change dialog sequences.
